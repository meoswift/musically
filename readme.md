Project Design:
Our project uses Web Speech API. Given a list of songs, the user will be
able to say a song name, and the song name will be recognized with the speech
recognizer. The user will then be able to press a button to play or pause the
song. For our final implementation, we removed the Spotify API from our plan
because it was not technologically feasible for the time we had, and instead 
included different mp3 files for the songs locally and provided the user
with a list of the available songs to play. 

Instructions:
Click the "Start/Stop" button on the top right of the page and say the title of
the song you would like to play from the given list of songs. Press the "Start/Stop"
button again when you are finished speaking. Press the "Play" button to play the song,
and the "Pause" button to pause the audio. 

UI Design Aspects:
We grouped the information we need to display to the user in different categories,
and displayed them near other widgets/information of the corresponding categories.
For example, all of the instructions and buttons that are related to the speech recognition
aspect of the program (the start/stop speaking button, instructions, etc.) are located at the
top of the page. All the song titles are grouped together and displayed on the bottom left 
of the page. All the buttons related to playing/pausing the audio are grouped and displayed
together on the bottom right of the screen. The web page is also responsive to changes in 
size and shape of the browser window.
